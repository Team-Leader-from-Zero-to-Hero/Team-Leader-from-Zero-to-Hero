# Dailies
## Purpose + How it Works
The purpose of the daily is to synchronize the whole team with what each team mate did the previous day and plans to do today.
Team mates should bring up problems that they encountered (so that others can know to help them later) but not go into too much detail.
Team mates should not be too general in describing what they did yesterday and what they are doing so that they don't repeat themselves everyday if they are working on a big task.
Team mates should know what they are doing today and not say "I don't know what I'm doing today". If they do say that, tell them on the spot to come to you after the daily so you can give them a task or think of a system where they can always know what their next task is (e.g. prioritize tasks in your taks pool).

- In the first hour of the day, not so early that people groan.
- Should be between five and ten minutes.
- Everyone should stand up, so that people will want to finish quickly.
- Make sure it doesn't get too technical so that the daily doesnt drag on for too long.
